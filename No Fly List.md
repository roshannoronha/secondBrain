Every week, approximately 1,500 airline travelers reportedly are mislabeled as terrorists due to errors in the data-matching program known as the “No Fly” list.42 Innocent individuals face extensive questioning and miss flights, never knowing why the automated system has targeted them.

Individuals on the “No Fly” list have no assured means to clear their names and could be detained every time they attempt to board an airplane.44 The data-mining algorithms45 of the Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP) automatically search databases containing the telephone and email records of millions of Americans, creating lists of people who fit terrorist profiles.46 Serious concerns have been raised not only about TSP’s legality,47 but also about the crudeness of the algorithms it employs and the inaccurate information upon which it relies.48 Unsophisticated algorithms and faulty data generate high rates of false positives that might serve as a basis for baseless, stigmatizing criminal investigations.49
