At the end of a very long week you decide you're finally going to take some time for yourself. So you put your phone on silent, make some popcorn and open up Netflix. And then begins the laborius process of figuring out what to watch. Selling Sunset? Nope, you binge watched both seasons. (more examples of trashy shows). Unsure about what to watch you go with what Netflix reccomends and your surprised when it's actually really good with just the right amount of story and the wrong amount of trashyness.

Contrary to popular belief, there's isn't a tiny man inside your tv that provides suggestions. Instead, Netflix uses specialized software that is capable of understanding your specific preferences and then that same software uses that information to predict what you would want to watch. In short, Netflix has automated the process of providing reccomendations by removing humans from the decision making process. 

Now some of you might question that statement. And perhaps if you were very bold you might even say "hang on a min, Roshan you handsome devil. I thought automation would involve a lot of fancy robots. But I didn't hear any robots in your story".  

In this day and age, thinking that automation is simply robots replacing manual labor paints an incomplete picture. While it's certainly used to replace manual labor, the reality is much more complex than that. Much of the technology we interact with is software based as well and so we need to consider how automatio is used in the software space. that it is used in a variety of industries so much more. Similar to how Netflix reccomends shows for you, in 2022 automation is much more suble. It's something that is in the background and yet capable of influencing more that just what we watch. It influences how we get hired, how we work, how we shop, how we play
