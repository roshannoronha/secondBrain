# 3 Min Draft

## Intro
At the end of a very long week you decide you're finally going to take some time for yourself. So you put your phone on silent, make some popcorn and open up Netflix. And then begins the labourous process of figuring out what to watch. Selling Sunset? Nope, you binge watched both seasons. The Witcher? Well watching Henry Cavill run in tight pants is too much stress. Unsure about what to watch, you go with what Netflix recommends and you end up loving the show. Turns out it's the perfect amount of story and trashyness.

Contrary to popular belief, there isn't a tiny man inside your tv that provides suggestions. Instead, Netflix uses specialized software that is capable of understanding your specific preferences and then that same software uses that information to predict what you would want to watch. In short, Netflix has automated the process of providing reccomendations by removing humans from the decision making process. 

In this day and age, automation is more than robots replacing manual labor. Turns out, automation is a lot like Netflix reccomending what to watch -  human independant software that is capable of influencing our behavior.
