Automation will change our society and it is through reflection that we can determine whether this change will be positive for all or just for a select few.

When you hear the word automation what comes to mind? Maybe it's a dystopian future like the matrix? Or perhaps it's like the Jetsons where robots and flying cars coexist?

In 2022, automation looks like…Netflix. For those of you that aren't familiar, Netflix generates recommendations for the shows you may like to watch based on shows you’ve previously watched. However,  instead of a person suggesting these recommendations for you, Netflix uses software to the same effect. Now the reason I use Netflix as an example is that most people have a flawed understanding of what automation looks like. There is an assumption that it’s loud and obvious - like the Jetsons and that we’ll know when it’s here. However, the reality is like Netflix - its software and hardware working in the background but capable influencing how we work and play.

There is a disconnect between the expectation - what people think automation is and the reality - how it’s actually being used. And when this reality doesn't line up with our internal definitions the end result is uncertainty. This is in part why this talk is so important - people are not sure about what automation is and they are unclear about how it will affect their friends, their families and themselves. Having this understanding is crucial so that we can have a say in how this technology is used.

It's also important because we're at a point where automation is being rolled out on a massive scale. And as with any new technology it has the potential to be both a change for good - helping us to discover new therapies for diseases or bad - by exacerbating existing social inequalities. Reflection is a core part of figuring out the direction of this change, as we need to consider the world we currently live in before implementing this technology in our lives even further.

Automation will change our society and it is through reflection that we can determine whether this change will be positive for just a select few or for everyone.
