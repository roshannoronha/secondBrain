## Intro
At the end of a very long week you decide you're finally going to take some time for yourself. So you put your phone on silent, make some popcorn and open up Netflix. And then begins the labourous process of figuring out what to watch. Selling Sunset? Nope, you binge watched both seasons. The Witcher? Well watching Henry Cavill run in tight pants is probably going to be too much stress. Unsure about what to watch, you go with what Netflix recommends and you end up loving the show. Turns out it's the perfect amount of story and trashyness.

Contrary to popular belief, there isn't a tiny man inside your tv that provides suggestions. Instead, Netflix uses software that is capable of understanding your specific preferences and then uses that information to predict what you would want to watch. In short, Netflix has automated the process of providing movie reccomendations.

If that example of automation surprised you, you're not alone. We've heard for years now about this thing called automation and how it's going to take our jobs. But, and be honest here, raise your hand if you unclear about what this means. This, is why I'm here.

You see, automation is already affecting you. Automated systems determine who get's hired, the people that qualify for healthcare... or don't qualify, and even who is put in the no fly list **(stress the problems a bit more)**. Because we're unclear about what automation is, it means that it's hard for us to have a say in how this technology is used. 

And so, today, we're going to define what automation is. We're going to see how it's being used. And most importantly...we're going to be empowered to have a say in whether this technology will be positive for just a select few or for everyone. **(change the we word)**

And as with any technology it has the potential to be both a change for good - helping us to discover new therapies for diseases or bad - by exacerbating existing social inequalities. And so it's vitially important that we gain Our uncertainty around automation 


And I'm going to provide you with the t

And the time to have this say is right now

There's a disconnect between what we think automation is and 



when we look around nothing really seems to have changed. 


raise your hand if you have no idea what this means.




Our understanding of automation is usually based on the idea of big machines doing repetive tasks. 


Turns out, it's a lot like Netflix reccomending what to watch -  human independant software that is capable of influencing our behavior and actions.

Why should you care?

## Cutting off Healthcare 
In 2016, Tammy who has cerebral palsy, noticed something odd. The amount of home care hours that she was allocated by the state of Arkansaw, had somehow decreased dramatically. Typically, someone with CP would receive around 60 hours of home care, but seeminly overnight, that number was halved. The result? Tammy was forced to make some tough choices. Go to church or keep her house clean? Prepare a meal or take a shower 

These choices were being made not just by Tammy, but coun

It's important that we update our understanding becuase we're at a point in time where it's being implemented in a wide range of industries but it's already starting to affect us. It affects how we get hired, who qualifies for healthcare, the ability of a plane to land and so much more. In order for us to have a say in how this technology is used we need to understand it
