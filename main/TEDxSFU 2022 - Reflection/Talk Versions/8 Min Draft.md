## Intro
At the end of a very long week you decide you're finally going to take some time for yourself. So you put your phone on silent, make some popcorn and open up Netflix. And then begins the labourous process of figuring out what to watch. Selling Sunset? Nope, you binge watched both seasons. The Witcher? Well watching Henry Cavill run in tight pants is probably going to be too much stress. Unsure about what to watch, you go with what Netflix recommends and you end up loving the show. Turns out it's the perfect amount of story and trashyness.

Contrary to popular belief, there isn't a tiny man inside your tv that provides suggestions. Instead, Netflix uses software that is capable of understanding your specific preferences and then uses that information to predict what you would want to watch. In short, Netflix has automated the process of providing movie reccomendations.

If that example of automation surprised you, you're not alone. We've heard for years now about this thing called automation and how it's going to take our jobs. But raise your hand if you're unsure about what this means or looks like? This, is why I'm here.

You see, automation is already affecting you. It determines who get's hired, the people that qualify for healthcare... or don't qualify, and even who is put in the no fly list **(stress the problems a bit more)**. Because we're unclear about what automation is, it means that it's hard for us to have a say in how this technology is used.

And so to clear up this up, today I'm going through what I like to call the three D's of automation. 

1. Define what automation is.
2. Describe how automation is being used and it's potential for abuse
3. Deliver useful insights to help you navigate and trhive in the automated world.

My hope that by the end of this talk, you'll not only understand what automation is but more importantly be empowered to have a say in whether this technology will be positive for just a select few or for everyone.


## Automation Definition

Broadly speaking, automation is defined as any technology that does work while minimizing human input. 

Technology that does work while minimizing human input...and the minimizing human input part is crucial here. If my dirty socks are on the floor and my girlfriend picks them up, I can't say that the process has been automated. Even though I'm not really doing any work, someone else is. On a totally unrelated note this might be why she's been upset since we started living together.

Ok, so back to automation. Typically when we think of automation, the easiest association or image that comes to mind would be something like this, where these robots are reducing the amount of human labor needed to build cars.

But there are so many other industries that are just as complex! For example, I work in the field of Laboratory Automation as an Automation Scientist. And essentially what that means is I collaborate with scientists and using robots like these

automate experiments for them. Why? Well for scientists, using automation allows for experiments that can be run more quickly, efficently and reproducibly. And this results in scientistics spending more time designing experiments and thinking criticially about the results instead of need to run tedious repetive tasks.

It's for this reason that over the past decade most clinal, pharmacuetical and life sciences labs have started to or are currently leveraging automation in the lab.

Now you might be thinking that "well I'm not a scientitics why should I care?". But what if I told you that in the past 2 and a half years, lab automation has affected your life.


## Story 1 - COVID-19

Over the past two years, a key player in the COVID-19 fight has been rapid, reliable testing. Prior to
