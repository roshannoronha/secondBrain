From the windwill to the steam engine, automation has played a crucial role in humanities progress. Typically this automation was intended to replace physical labour and when introduced would usually lead to societal changes.

In the past decade we've started to see the rise of automation that replicates not just physical labour but cognitive labour as well. What does this type of automation look like and if used how will it affect us?

In my talk we're going to focus on 3 key things to answer this question. We'll first start by understanding what automation is and see how it's being used in a variety of industries from biotech to space.

Second, we'll look at the both the positive and negative effects of this integration at individual as well as well as societal levels.

Lastly, I'll address what the audience can do to not only navigate but also thrive this space.
