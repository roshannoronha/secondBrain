## Intro
At the end of a very long week, you decide you're finally going to take some time for yourself. So you put your phone on silent, pop some popcorn and open up Netflix. And then of course begins the laborious process of figuring out what to watch. Selling Sunset? Nope, you already binge-watched both seasons. The Witcher? Well, watching Henry Cavill run in tight pants is probably going to be too much stress. Unsure about what to watch, you go with what Netflix recommends, and you end up loving the show. Turns out it's the perfect amount of story and trash TV.

Contrary to popular belief, there isn't a tiny man inside your TV that providing those suggestions. Instead, Netflix uses software that is capable of understanding your specific preferences and then uses that information to predict what you would want to watch. In short, Netflix has automated the process of providing movie recommendations.

If that example of automation surprised you, you're not alone. We've heard for years now about this thing called automation and how it's going to take our jobs. But raise your hand if you're unsure about what this means or looks like? This, is why I'm here.

You see, automation is already affecting you. It determines who gets hired, the people that qualify for healthcare... or don't qualify, and even who is put in the no-fly list. Because we're unclear about what automation is, it means that it's hard for us to have a say in how this technology is used.

And so, for those of you that could use some clarity, today I'm going through what I like to call the three D's of automation. 

1. Define what automation is.
2. Describe how automation is being used, and it's potential for abuse
3. Deliver useful insights to help you navigate and thrive in an increasingly automated world.

Define. Describe. Deliver.

<!-- My hope that by the end of this talk, you'll not only understand what automation is but more importantly be empowered to have a say in whether this technology will be positive for just a select few or for everyone.-->


## Automation Definition

Let's start with our first D, define, and automation is defined as any technology that does work while minimizing human input. 

Technology that does work while minimizing human input...and the minimizing human input part is crucial here. If my dirty socks are on the floor and my girlfriend picks them up, I can't say that the process has been automated. Even though I'm not really doing any work, someone else is. The process would be automated if there was a machine of some kind that picked up the socks for me so that no other person had to. 

Now take a minute and think about the type of work you do on a daily basis...it's probably a safe bet that at least some of it happens in front of a computer, right? 

Just like how machines can reduce the amount of work we need to do, software can also achieve the same effect! 

We can use software to find new galaxies

or land rockets so they can be reused

These are examples of tasks that would take us time and effort to accomplish, and using software to automate the process enables us to reclaim that time and effort.

And of course there are industries that bridge both hardware and software! For example, I work in the field of Laboratory Automation as an Automation Scientist. And essentially what that means is I collaborate with scientists and program robots like these to replicate the manual steps that scientists do to run an experiment. 

Why? Well for starters I get to work in a lab and play with robots which is awesome. And for the scientists, leveraging automation allows for experiments that can be run more quickly, efficently and reproducibly. And this results in scientists spending more time designing experiments and thinking criticially about the results instead of needing to be in the lab.

It's for this reason that over the past decade most clinical, pharmaceutical and life sciences laboratories have started to or are currently leveraging automation in the lab.

Now you might be thinking that "well I'm not a scientitics why should I care?". But what if I told you that in the past 2 and a half years, lab automation has probably affected your life.


## Story 1 - COVID-19

Over the past two years, a key player in the COVID-19 fight has been rapid, reliable testing. At the start of the pandemic, labs around the world were swamped...with thousands of patient samples to process. 

Here in BC, we could only do about 200 COVID-19 tests a day with each batch of patient samples taking about 10 hours to be processed. Additionally, samples would have to be sent to the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnepeg for the results to be confirmed.

In April 2020, a mere 1 month after the pandemic was annouched here, BC was able to process over 6000 COVID-19 tests a day and deliver results in 24 hours. What changed? Automation

More specifically, this machine right here - the Cobas 6800 analyzer. Using 3 of these machines enabled us to fully automated the COVID-19 testing process. But the increase in throughput wasn't the only benefit. Automation meant that lab technicians could instead focus on ensuring the samples were correctly labelled and triple checking patient results.

I like to use this example as it highlights two key things. The first, is that it shows just how impactful automation already is as rapid reliable testing certainly helped to prevent the spread of COVID in our communities. Secondly, this impact was acheived not only by automation and robots but the people working with these systems as well.

But what happens when we take people out of this picture?

<!--
1. Recieve nasal swab or saliva samples 
2. Barcode samples and enter info into LIMS
3. Add a solution to inactivate virus and release it's genetic material if it was present
4. Extract the genetic material
6. Using a technique called PCR amplify only viral DNA
7. Technician anlyzes the data to determine which samples are COVID-positive.

Note

- Technolocy that does the work
- Make the link between socks pickup not being automation
- select few or everyone (might reconsider)
- Guilty pleasure insteada of trashyness
- Bit more emphaty at the start?
- Tech giant instead of netflix
- End on deliver
- More images about current automation + robots cars
- Add UK as an example for COVID testing
- COVID mismanaged by govn so maybe don't use it as an example?
- put what it looks like instead of what it means
