# Healthcare and Social Services

## Overview

If done incorrectly automation can affect how we received or qualify for health care and social services.

This is for a number of reasons.

1) The datasets used to train health care software can have existing biases. This means that 
2) The people in charge of rolling out these algrithms may not have enough context to see if the algorithm is evaluating things correctly.
3) The programmers may not have enough context for the topic they are programming.
4) Removes the human element so individual cases/exemptions may not be considered.
5) Tend to be a black box. No one is sure how a decision is reached since numerous parameters are used to make the final calculation
